# Test-Driven Development

##  Plan Ahead

### Study the user stories first (As...., I want...., so that....)
### What features/components need test coverage most?
### What are the high priority test cases?
## For persistence layer: what type? relational, graph or both?
### What type of test is needed? Unit(Single Unit)? Integration(Test interaction between units)? Both?
